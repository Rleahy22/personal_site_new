  <h2 class="questions">Why Am I A Developer?</h2>
  <p class="answers">It was not until my last semester of college that I got my intro to programming in a class aptly called "Intro to Programming."  For the first time in my educational history I took a class because I thought the material sounded interesting.  I loved it.  However, I spent the next year working in a job suited to my major, working with spreadsheets everyday. Fortunately, I was able to find excuses to program in Visual Basic every chance I got (and I worked hard to find these excuses). Over time I found that I was by far the happiest when I was programming. So, I asked myself, "If this is what you love to do, why don't you do that everyday?"</p>
  <h2 class="questions">How Did I Become a Developer?</h2>
  <p class="answers">Even before I decided to make my passion become my career I took courses on Codecademy, Coursera, and borrowed books from the library (that's right, the library) to learn more about coding.  But once I made the decision to change my life, I knew I needed to do more.  So I applied to Dev Bootcamp, and began a 9-week intensive course in web development using Ruby on Rails.  Starting June 3, I spent 90-100 hours a week at the DBC office pair programming, listening to lectures from brilliant instructors, and working on team projects with some of the most passionate budding developers around.</p>
  <h2 class="questions">What Now?</h2>
  <p class="answers">Dev Bootcamp helped me become a world-class beginner, and I am ready to keep learning and honing my craft.  I want to begin a career in which I can build amazing products, work with passionate teammates, and spend the rest of my life learning as much as I can.</p>
